# Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing

This project implements an Artificial Intelligence model for sentiment analysis
using Natural Language Processing techniques. Text data is converted into numerical
features using TF-IDF, and a Naive Bayes classifier is trained to classify sentiments
as positive or negative.

The model is evaluated on unseen test data and also supports real-time sentiment
prediction for custom user input. This project demonstrates the application of AI
and NLP in understanding human emotions from text.
